# AutoWebex
This 300 lines of code runs webex and puts you and disconnects you from classes by time comparison

Written in python 3.9
------------------------
In order for the code to work you'll need to pip some stuff:
1. pywinauto
2. selenium
3. pause
4. pyautogui
5. pygetwindow

After you pip all these, all you need to do to make it work for your classes is to change the class links with your own (and make new variables for your classes) in 82nd line and download chromedriver.exe. After that you'll need to adjust the times & in the if's & elif's statements change the vars to your classes and the executable path for chromedriver. if your classes don't last 40 minutes or you dont have the same professor for 2-3 periods straight like i do just change the pause times & make sure to change what times the program checks to see in which class it should put you on.


Enjoy!
